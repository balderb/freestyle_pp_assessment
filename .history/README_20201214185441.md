# freestyle_pp_assessment

## Motivation
This is a freestyle trial as an assessment for intracto Ghent. In this project, I try to build on top of a previous 
pixel perfect assessment and used some of my creative design skills. I paid attention to readability of the code, 
best practices and semantic html elements.
