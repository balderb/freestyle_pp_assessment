# freestyle assessment for Intracto Ghent
## Motivation
This is a project for an assessment @ intracto Ghent. In this project, I try to build on top of a previous 
pixel perfect assessment and used some of my creative design skills. I paid attention to readability of the code, 
best practices, responsiveness of the page and semantic html elements.
