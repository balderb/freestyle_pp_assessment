# Freestyle assessment for Intracto Ghent
## Motivation
This is a project for an assessment @ Intracto Ghent. In this project, I try to build on top of a previous 
pixel perfect assessment and used some of my creative design skills. I paid attention to readability of the code, 
best practices from a previous example, responsiveness of the page as well as semantic HTML elements.

## TechStack used
HTML / Cascading Style Sheets
CSS flexbox & Grid
